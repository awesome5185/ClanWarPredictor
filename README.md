# ClanWarPredictor

This tool allows you to input a playertag in which the model will calculate the odds of a clan war win against a specified opponent!
It uses a 10 variable linear regression analysis to calculate these odds which means yes, sometimes it can overshoot 0% or 100%.  

###### Anyways I'm going to take this oppotunity to plug my clan: Awesome Empire#9Q9CLR - Join if you have around 5k PB, we're Gold II!

# Setup
You'll need the data2.csv file in the same location as the Predictor.exe file.  
Run Predictor.exe  
???  
Profit  

# Data
There's currently around 500 datasets in the data2.csv file but you can potentially generate more if you go to  
"Show Advanced Options" -> Refresh Sources.  
Keep in mind this will overwrite the existing file
and can take around an hour to generate ~500 datasets.

# Usage
Please don't reupload this on the internet; if someone wants the program, link em back here! I spent like ~30+ hours on this over the course
of 5 days.
